<!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body> <h1 class=>This is a motherfucking website.</h1><p class=>And it's fucking perfect.</p><h2 class=>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2><p class=>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p><ul><li class=>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li><li class=>Fits on all your shitty screens</li><li class=>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li><li class=>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li><li class=>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li></ul> </body></html>
